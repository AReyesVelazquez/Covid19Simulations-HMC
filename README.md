These two Python Programs reproduce the results presented in https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c01064.
They simulate the spread of COVID-19 in the United States between 01/20/2020 - 01/19/2021 by using the Gillespie Algorithm and a proposed modification to it named the Leapfrog Gillespie Algorithm.

The results produced by a particular run of these simulations are
